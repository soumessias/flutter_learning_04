My fourth app made with Dart/Flutter! ðŸš€

In it I learned about:
* Using Image as an Asset
* How to make more stylish UI combining containers and decorators
* How to use ListView.separated
* How to add a font family in the entire project with a new font
* How to navigate back from a Screen without using AppBar (using Navigator.pop())
* How to use Provider to easily deal with states in different components
* How to use PopUpMenuButton and Items
* How to use the Badges Package to create a badge on the shopping cart Icon
* How to use Chip Widget
* How to combine Card with ListTile
* How to manually call Drawer from a IconButton
